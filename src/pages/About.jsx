            I'm 32 years old, bachelor degree in biology at UNESP - Botucatu.

            But I never went down the path of Biology, once I finished the
            university I decided to work at my Father's gas station.

            There I worked as a manager, responsible for 13 co-workers,
            finances, managing stock, paperwork and day-to-day problems.

            By the year of 2022 I decided to pursue my desire to work with
            technology, and started to learn about programming. I enrolled
            myself in Trybe's web development course. In which I learned a lot
            of what I know now, but I'm always looking for new challenges and
            new things to learn.
          </p>
          <p className="fadein15">
            I'm quite sure that I've found my true passion, and I'm now looking
            for a opportunity to complete this transition in my career, becoming
            a dev for your company! ðŸ˜„
